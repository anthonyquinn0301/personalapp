You can view information about famous composers from the past.
There is also the option of answering a survey and then musical quiz via
forms.  Finally, once you sign in to your google account, you can access the my genres tab in the menu-bar in order to add a list of genres of music you like.  In the demo page, there is a table using bootstrap about the composers and the form with the survey.  Below that, there is a carousel of the composers and their pictures.  If you click on the picture, you'll be redirected to their wikipedia page. Clicking on the name brings you to a Youtube radio playlist of their music.  For fun, there is a key word search for Ice and Fire that displays information about certain keywords in json format.
